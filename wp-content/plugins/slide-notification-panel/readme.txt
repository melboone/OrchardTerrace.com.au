== Frequently asked questions ==

= What if I don't know HTML? =

You can make eye-catching panels without any HTML knowledge simply typing in the HTML Content section of the Add/Edit Panel page. You can also use the default content of the HTML Content field to get an idea how to perform simple actions with HTML, such as insert images or links -- just replace the given links with your own.

One great way to get good HTML content is to use WordPress's own post/page editor. Create your panel content in the Visual part of the editor, then click the "HTML" tab on the top right of the editor. You can then copy the HTML of what you just created and paste it right into the HTML content section of your panel!

= Where can I see the plugin in action? =

Visit our demo site at http://tnbizcoop.com/slidedemo to see a number of example panels! Keep in mind that these just scrape the surface of what's possible. Since SNP is so versatile, if you can think of it, and can do it in HTML, you can put it in a panel.
